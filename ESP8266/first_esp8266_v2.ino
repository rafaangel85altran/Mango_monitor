/**
 * This program will create a pass-through serial connection to the ESP module. This makes it possible to send AT commands to the device.
 * For a new device, you might have to try several connections speeds! (see comment at line 54: "your esp's baud rate might be different")
 * Open the Serial Monitor (Tools>Serial Monitor) to send AT-commands.
 * 
 * Build circuit as detailed here: https://home.et.utwente.nl/slootenvanf/2018/03/17/connect-esp8266-control-blynk/
 * Make sure the ESP module gets its own separate power supply of 3.3V
 * 
 * In the serial monitor set the speed to 115200 (to match the speed set at line 52).
 * This program will try sending the command AT+GMR first.
 * Does that produce readable information? Then proceed to "Initialize a new device".
 * If not, adjust the speed at line 54, upload again and see what happens.
 * 
 * Initialize a new device:
 * Send:
 * AT+RST                         # Reset
 * AT+UART_DEF=9600,8,1,0,0       # Default baud to 9600,N,8,1,no flow ctl
 * 
 * After this, set the speed at line 54 to 9600 (only if you changed it), and upload again to send the remaining commands:
 * 
 * AT+CWMODE=1                    # Station mode (client)
 * ATE0                           # Command echo off
 * 
 * Other commands (which you do not neeed now!)
 * Show version info: AT+GMR
 * Set it to different speed: AT+UART_DEF=9600,8,1,0,0 (then update sketch) (https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/38289/at-command-is-not-responding-on-serial-monitor)
 * Search Access Points: AT+CWLAP
 * Connect to WIFI: AT+CWJAP="Your Wifi Name","Your Wifi Password"
 * Check Allocated Ip: AT+CIFSR
 * 
 * If this returns an error, the module maybe configured as an access point, try searching for Wifi networks on your laptop, it might show up there, eg. as "AI-THINKER_A3ECE2"
 * To turn it into a client and connect to a Wifi network:
